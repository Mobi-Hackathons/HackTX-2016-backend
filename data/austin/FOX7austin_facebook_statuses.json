Jennifer Kendall on FOX 7 was in high school in Chatham, New Jersey. Many of her classmates had family members who worked in New York City and even in the Twin Towers..\n\n\"On September, 11, 2001, I was in the Chatham High School cafeteria (New Jersey) listening to the chaos of the attack on the World Trade Center on the radio. Chatham, where I grew up, is a town where many of our parents worked in NYC and several of them worked in the Twin Towers.\n\nThat day, cell phone coverage was down in NYC. Administrators at our school put post-it notes on the window to let students know if they heard from their parents. (see picture)\n\nIt was terrifying. Everyone was standing by the office hoping the next post-it would read that their parents were okay. None of us knew what would happen. And there were some in my school who lost family members in that terrorist attack.\n\nMy father worked in the World Trade Center a lot back then. He had meetings in the towers with clients all the time. He was not there that day and I remember how grateful I was to finally hear his voice. \n\nThat's something I will never forget.\n\nMore importantly, I will never forget how many people never heard from their parents, their children, their friends, their family members or coworkers again. It's a day that shattered so many hearts.\n\nOnce I left CHS for the day, I visited a cemetery in my town that sat high up on a hill. My friends and I watched the smoke rising from the NYC skyline. I knew then that life as we knew it would never be the same. But we have come back STRONGER. We stood together TALLER. We held each other CLOSER.\n\nI am forever grateful to those who ran in to save others when the towers started to fall. You are true heroes and deserve all the recognition in the world. I can still feel the heartbreak we all shared that day. It still haunts me every time this anniversary comes around.\n\nThank you NYPD and FDNY for the lives you've saved. I'm so sorry you lost so many of your own. We will NEVER forget the sacrifices that were made on September 11, 2001... \"", "status_type": "photo"}{"status_link": "https://www.facebook.com/FOX7austin/videos/10154664978312494/", "num_loves": 27, "num_sads": 33, "status_id": "125200554188098_10154664978312494", "num_comments": 7, "num_wows": 0, "num_reactions": 230, "num_hahas": 1, "link_name": "", "num_likes": 169, "status_published": "2016-09-11 16:00:00", "num_shares": 25, "num_angrys": 0, "status_message": "WE REMEMBER: See the moment the American flag was draped over the Pentagon where Flight 77 struck 15 years ago. #UnitedWeStand", "status_type": "video"}{"status_link": "http://www.fox7austin.com/news/local-news/204517396-story", "num_loves": 0, "num_sads": 61, "status_id": "125200554188098_1271620186212790", "num_comments": 8, "num_wows": 15, "num_reactions": 121, "num_hahas": 2, "link_name": "Officials investigating after 3 found dead in Bastrop", "num_likes": 43, "status_published": "2016-09-11 15:13:15", "num_shares": 51, "num_angrys": 0, "status_message": "The Bastrop County Sheriff's Office said in a news release Sunday that the bodies were discovered Saturday afternoon.

Abdul-Khaliq has been with the Austin Police Department for 17 years and was most recently assigned to APD's Highway Enforcement Command. Prior to joining APD, Abdul-Khaliq served in the Marines. Our hearts, thoughts and prayers are with his family. Officer Abdul-Khaliq was an individual that we all loved and served as a great role model for his children, his peers and our community.\n\nThe department appreciates all the tireless efforts that the staff from University Medical Center at Brackenridge Hospital provided and their heroic efforts. At this time, the details honoring Officer Abdul-Khaliq are being planned and when that information is available we will share with everyone. Thank you again to all who donated blood, provided support and offered prayers.
